# fcc-tributepage
a tribute page for the responsive web design course on freecodecamp.

the tribute page that I made was about Alan Turing, a brilliant computer scientist who created the Universal Turing Machine, helped crack Enigma and is widely considered as "The Father" of Computer Science.

You're free to modify, study or copy the code if you would like.
